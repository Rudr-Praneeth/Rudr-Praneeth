# Praneeth Narayan  
**Interactive Web Engineer**

I design and engineer cinematic web experiences where motion, timing, and restraint carry the narrative.  
My work focuses on **controlled animation, visual storytelling, and execution quality** — not decoration.

I approach the web like film:  
slow builds, intentional stillness, and transitions that feel earned.

## What I Do

- Engineer **cinematic, interactive websites** with a strong sense of pacing  
- Translate visual concepts into **precise, buildable motion systems**  
- Design interactions that feel **deliberate, heavy, and composed**  
- Balance creative ambition with production-ready execution

Every project is planned before it’s animated.  
Nothing moves without a reason.

## Approach

- Motion is narrative, not noise  
- Stillness is as important as movement  
- Fewer effects, stronger impact  
- Timing > complexity  
- Quality over spectacle

I optimize for clarity, emotion, and control — the kind that holds attention without asking for it.

## Currently Exploring

Alongside frontend engineering, I’m building a strong foundation in **AI / ML**, focusing on:
- how models work at a fundamental level  
- how data and parameters shape behavior  
- the mathematical intuition behind learning systems  

This is a long-term investment, approached with the same discipline I bring to engineering.

## Work Status

- Open to **full-time opportunities**
- Actively **freelancing**  
- Shipped multiple client websites

I’m selective with projects and prioritize depth over volume.
