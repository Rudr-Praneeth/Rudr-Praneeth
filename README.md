# Praneeth Narayan  
**Interactive Web Engineer**

I design and engineer cinematic web experiences where motion, timing, and restraint carry the narrative.  
My work focuses on **controlled animation, visual storytelling, and execution quality** not decoration.
I approach the web like film:  
slow builds, intentional stillness, and transitions that feel earned.
